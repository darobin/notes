        XXX
        This is a dump of the notes taken to date because I've had to return the original book I
        received:

        EM  07
        N   07  § ending "run in reverse", "Can this be shows to be entropy-asymmetric in that the
                  change in energy increases entropy, or on the contrary is it a simple case in
                  which entropy is what makes the difference?"
        HL  12  § starting "And note that the two", start at "And as a matter of fact" to end of §

        EM  19
        N   19  bottom: "if it's a state, shouldn't it have all the required information? why would
                  it not have full coordinates? I don't get this."
        HL  20  § starting "This thing is that this identification", to end of §
        EM  21
        N   21  § starting "And so", "ah!"
        N   21  bottom: "good problem"
        N   22  § starting "I mentioned three such", "are the first two just about 'records'? How do
                  records relate to the 2nd law? Do they require/imply coarse-graining?"
        HL  23  footnote 1 from "And since everything" to "microconditions into subsets"
        HL  24  § starting "There are any number", from "And it has been a very deep" to end of
                  sentence
        HL  25  footnote 2
        HL  27  § starting "And it's with transitions like that" to end of §

        EM  45
        HL  45  § starting "But before", from "It makes it appear" to end of §
        EM  50
