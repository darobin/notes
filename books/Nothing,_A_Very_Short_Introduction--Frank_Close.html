      XXX
        - a lot of this can be generated from script
        - resist the temptation to just write ReSpec 4
        - this is slower, but it also forces me to go through the books again, which is actually
          really a feature
        - don't try to automate this or turn it into a blog or whatever, just plain HTML and links
